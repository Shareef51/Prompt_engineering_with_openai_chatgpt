# 🧠 Exploring Prompt Engineering Patterns

This repository explores **advanced Prompt Engineering patterns** used in LLM (Large Language Model) design and development.  
Each pattern demonstrates a structured approach to building reliable, consistent, and high-performing AI prompts for reasoning, creativity, and automation tasks.

## 📘 Project Overview

Prompt Engineering is the art and science of crafting input instructions that guide an AI model to produce accurate, context-aware, and useful outputs.  
This repository contains examples, explanations, and best practices for **9 fundamental prompt design patterns** used in modern LLM workflows.

## 🧩 Patterns Covered

### **Task 01: Persona Pattern**
Define a role or identity for the model to adopt during interaction.  
✅ *Goal:* Improve contextual alignment and tone by assigning the model a persona (e.g., “You are a cybersecurity expert”).  
📘 *Example:*  
> “You are a Senior IT Support Engineer. Explain how to diagnose a system crash in Windows 11.”

---

### **Task 02: Flipped Interaction Pattern**
Reverse the traditional user–model interaction.  
✅ *Goal:* Let the model ask questions first to clarify before answering.  
📘 *Example:*  
> “Before solving my problem, ask me 3 clarification questions.”

---

### **Task 03: N-Shot Prompting Pattern**
Provide **N examples** (1-shot, 3-shot, etc.) to guide model behavior.  
✅ *Goal:* Increase precision and consistency in structured responses.  
📘 *Example:*  
> Provide 3 sample customer queries and model replies before generating a new one.

---

### **Task 04: Directional Stimulus Pattern**
Use explicit hints or cues to guide the model’s reasoning path.  
✅ *Goal:* Steer the model toward the desired reasoning style or tone.  
📘 *Example:*  
> “Think step-by-step like a system administrator diagnosing a network issue.”

---

### **Task 05: Template Pattern**
Build reusable structured prompt templates for repeatable tasks.  
✅ *Goal:* Standardize prompt formats across workflows.  
📘 *Example:*  
> ```
> [Role]: [Define role here]  
> [Task]: [Describe the main objective]  
> [Context]: [Provide relevant details]  
> [Output Format]: [Define output structure]
> ```

---

### **Task 06: Meta Language Pattern**
Describe the prompt’s behavior **using language about the language** itself.  
✅ *Goal:* Improve the model’s understanding of instructions and style control.  
📘 *Example:*  
> “Respond using concise technical documentation language.”

---

### **Task 07: Chain of Thought Pattern**
Encourage explicit reasoning by asking the model to “think step-by-step.”  
✅ *Goal:* Improve logical accuracy and explainability.  
📘 *Example:*  
> “Explain your reasoning step-by-step before giving the final answer.”

---

### **Task 08: Self-Consistency Pattern**
Use multiple reasoning paths and choose the most consistent or common result.  
✅ *Goal:* Enhance reliability through multi-path validation.  
📘 *Example:*  
> “Generate three possible solutions and select the one that best fits the problem.”

---

### **Task 09: Least to Most Pattern**
Tackle complex problems by solving smaller sub-problems first.  
✅ *Goal:* Improve reasoning depth and problem-solving accuracy.  
📘 *Example:*  
> “Break the task into smaller steps and solve each in order from simplest to most complex.”
